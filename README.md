# Multiple User Auth

## What is it?

Current project in alpha (not hosted) with custom user authentication and administrators. Looking forward, I intend to have a series of collected work per user, stored in another table of the database. Ability to organize in different lists, save, edit, and delete each collected piece of work.

- error handling & redirection

### Technologies
