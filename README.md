# Multiple User Auth

## What is it?

Current project in alpha with custom user authentication and administrators. Looking forward, I intend to have a series of collected work per user, stored in another table of the database. Ability to organize in different lists, save, edit, and delete each collected piece of work. I was inspired by forums for this specific project and wanted to know exactly what it took to build from the ground level.

### Currently

Just getting started!
